 ## A note on tree supports
 The relevant tree support generation settings are **layer height** and **tip diameter**. For best performance, your layer height setting used for the print should be the same as the tree support generator setting. The tip diameter (tip of the tree supports) should be the same as your printer's nozzle diameter.
